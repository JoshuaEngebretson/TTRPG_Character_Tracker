# TTRPG_Character_Tracker
For tracking character information associated with the Table Top Role Playing Game
of Dungeouns and Dragons - 5E

Added in jQuery, but have not yet utilized.

May want to either further build out emojis that get console.logged, or remove them.
  -- Thought behind keeping (though they will no longer be logged in the console and would instead show up on DOM) is to have more visual indicators when    taking damage or healing.
  -- Possible long term goal of creating text-based adventure. If this is created further functionality of screen adjustments when causing damage could take place.
